# InvoHub continuous completion loop queue

Base branch: `main`. Backlog is grouped by product phase (see `CLAUDE.md`
and `docs/product-roadmap.md`); within a phase, complete items top to
bottom unless a later note explicitly re-prioritizes. One backlog item = one
branch = one PR (see `.claude/skills/ship-slice/SKILL.md`).

Checkbox states: `[ ]` not started, `[x]` done, `[~] folyamatban
(claude/platform-overhaul)` actively being worked by a specific branch —
when you pick up a `[~]` item, check whether that branch already covers it
before starting a duplicate.

## Phase 0 — Stabilization

Cross-cutting hardening that doesn't belong to one feature phase. Do this
before or alongside Phase 1 items that depend on it.

- [ ] Seed/demo data and admin-endpoint security audit — confirm
      `lib/seed/demo-data.ts` cannot run outside a demo context and that no
      seeded/admin account ships with a predictable or blank password
      reachable in production (`app/api/admin/**`, `lib/admin/service.ts`)
- [ ] Reminders cron reliability — confirm `app/api/cron`/`app/api/reminders`
      + `lib/reminders/process.ts` handle retries and partial failures, not
      just the happy path
- [ ] Auth E2E test user/fixture so authenticated Playwright specs can run
      (this unblocks the Phase 1 "create→preview→PDF E2E" item below)
- [ ] Credential encryption audit across NAV, M2M, and API-key storage —
      confirm `lib/nav/credentials.ts`, `lib/m2m/credentials.ts`, and
      `lib/api-keys/crypto.ts` actually encrypt at rest (check the
      primitive, not just the file name) and never log a raw secret
- [ ] Tax-audit export size/row limit — confirm `lib/export/tax-audit.ts`
      and its API route are scoped per-user and bounded, not an unbounded
      dump
- [ ] i18n gap sweep — use `.claude/skills/i18n-sync/SKILL.md` to enumerate
      every screen still missing translation coverage and file the gaps as
      sub-items here once the sweep names them (a prior audit flagged ~11
      screens with gaps but they need re-confirming against current code
      before being listed individually)

## Phase 1 — Core invoicing, NAV-compliant

Launch gate (see `docs/product-roadmap.md`): Hungarian invoicing rules
verified against Áfa tv. 169. §, NAV OSA end-to-end certified with test
credentials, security/privacy review passed.

Already shipped:
- [x] Dashboard overdue vs outstanding + VAT from line items
- [x] Saved invoice PDF preview via credentialed blob URL
- [x] New invoice: client picker, company bank prefill, email/NAV on send,
      notes meta
- [x] Server-side invoice list status + search filters
- [x] Login polish + HU/EN language switcher + EV-first nav order
- [x] Floating transparent marketing nav, HU/EN marketing copy fixes,
      cookie-consent CTA

Remaining for the launch gate:
- [ ] Authenticated create→preview→PDF E2E (blocked on the Phase 0 auth
      test-user item above)
- [ ] AAM/TAM/fordított adózás review — confirm invoice VAT-treatment text
      and 0%-VAT handling match `.claude/skills/hu-invoicing-rules/SKILL.md`
      (mark anything the skill flags "ellenőrizendő" as needing human tax
      sign-off before closing this item)
- [ ] Invoice numbering sequence — confirm gapless, concurrency-safe
      numbering (a DB-level sequence/constraint, not just an in-app
      counter) in `lib/invoices/` / `db/schema.ts`
- [ ] Payment fields completeness — payment method, bank account, due-date
      handling reviewed end to end (`lib/payments/`, `db/schema.ts`)
- [ ] Storno / helyesbítő correction linkage — correction and cancellation
      invoices must reference the original invoice id and remain
      NAV-reportable, not just an internal note
- [ ] Invoice edit screen for draft/unsent invoices
- [ ] NAV OSA 3.0 real client wiring with an explicit demo/test/production
      mode switch surfaced in settings (never defaulting to production)
- [ ] NAV submission status polling UI — poll transaction status after
      submit and surface rejection reasons, not just a boolean
- [ ] Company lookup via NAV `queryTaxpayer` to auto-fill buyer/company
      details instead of manual entry only

## Phase 2 — Bank data connection & paid/unpaid matching

CSV / camt.053 import ships **before** any live bank/PSD2 connection.
Never auto-finalize an uncertain match — only exact, unambiguous matches
may auto-confirm.

- [x] Pure match candidate scoring (amount / remittance / name / date; no
      auto-finalize unless exact) — `lib/bank-matching/`
- [ ] Bank statement import: CSV and camt.053 parsing (`lib/import/`)
- [ ] Matching engine wiring + human review UI for non-exact candidates
- [ ] PSD2 / live bank provider evaluation — only after CSV/camt.053 import
      has shipped and been used; needs its own security/provider review
      before any code is written against a real provider

## Phase 3 — EV tax calculator

Launch gate: Hungarian tax-professional validation against regression
fixtures. Never hardcode a tax figure nobody has sourced and verified.

- [ ] Tax rules versioning scaffolding — `lib/tax/rules/<year>.ts` per
      `.claude/skills/ev-tax-rules/SKILL.md` (sourced, dated, confidence-
      tagged figures; TODOs instead of guesses)
- [ ] Calculator UI with explainable output and the required "estimate,
      not tax advice" disclaimer in both `hu.ts` and `en.ts`
- [ ] Tax-professional validation of the rule files and regression
      fixtures — human sign-off, tracked here as its own checkbox, not
      assumed once the code exists

## Phase 4 — NAV M2M tax-return submission

Launch gate: threat model, load testing, NAV failure/recovery
verification, and legal review before any marketing copy claims InvoHub
replaces an accountant.

- [ ] M2M tax-return submission wiring beyond the current Adózó API
      exploration (`lib/m2m/`) — idempotent submission, signed webhooks,
      retry/dead-letter handling, audit logs
- [ ] Clarify and implement the power-of-attorney (meghatalmazás) flow
      required for InvoHub to submit on behalf of an EV — this is a legal
      prerequisite, not just an API credential
- [ ] Legal review of any copy claiming InvoHub replaces an accountant —
      required before that claim can appear anywhere, including marketing
